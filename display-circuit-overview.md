# Display Circuit

You will now build the display, so that the temperature can be displayed on it rather than the computer. The display will be made up of 7-segment displays, shift registers, resistors, wire, and a few capacitors. As you can see from the full project diagram below, the display circuit is large, so the instructions are broken up into several steps.
