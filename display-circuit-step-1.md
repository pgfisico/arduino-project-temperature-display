# Display Circuit - Step 1

The first step of building the display is to place the major components and connect them to power and ground as appropriate.

Disconnect the Arduino board from the computer and add the components pictured below to your breadboard.

> #### Note::Important Notes
>
> * To make the diagram easier to read, the components you have already placed (such as the temperature sensor) are not shown. Do not remove them from the breadboard, just leave them where they are.
> * Place the components exactly where they are shown to ensure your project fits on the breadboard, start by placing the shift registers and 7-segment displays first.
> * Just as with the temperature sensor circuit, the blue component near the shift register is a capacitor. It should be placed as close to the shift register as possible.
> * The resistors in the diagram are placed diagonally. It is very important that the two ends of your resistor are in two different rows on the breadboard.

After adding the components in the diagram above, your project will look something like the image below.

> #### Success::Check your Circuit
>
> Before continuing, check your circuit to confirm it is wired correctly. Ask a mentor to double check the circuit after you have checked it.
>
> This circuit has a lot of wiring and components that are placed close to each other. Ensure all the connections are correct and that there are no short circuits created by exposed conductors.
