# Display Circuit - Step 1





Disconnect the Arduino board from the computer and construct the circuit pictured on this page.  

---
# TODO
- Add on to the previous circuit
- INFO?? Place the shift register in the breadboard in the exact position identified in the circuit diagram, so you do not have to move it later.
- Caps are reused here - close to IC, add img with circles??
- Provide labelled A-H outputs for shift register outs
- Explain diagonal resistors

> Before continuing, check your circuit to confirm it is wired correctly.
>
> This circuit has a lot of wiring and components that are placed close to each other. Ensure all the connections are correct and that there are no short circuits created by exposed conductors.
