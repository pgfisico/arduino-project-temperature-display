# Display Circuit - Step 3

The third step of building the display is to connect the first shift register to the Arduino, and to connect the two shift registers together.

Add the wires shown in the diagram below to your breadboard.

> #### Note::Important Note
>
> The yellow wire connecting the two shift registers together is different from the other three wires connecting them together. The yellow wire connects to different pins on each shift register while the other three wires connect the same pins on each shift register.

After adding the wires, your project will look something like the picture below.

> #### Success::Check your Circuit
>
> Before continuing, check your circuit to confirm it is wired correctly. Ask a mentor to double check the circuit after you have checked it.
>
> This circuit has a lot of wiring and components that are placed close to each other. Ensure all the connections are correct and that there are no short circuits created by exposed conductors.
