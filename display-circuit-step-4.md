# Display Circuit - Step 4

The final step of building the display is to connect the 7-segment displays to the resistors.

Add the wires shown in the diagram below to your breadboard.

> #### Note::Important Notes
>
> * The wires from the resistors to the displays go in the same order on each end (i.e. a wire goes from the leftmost resistor to the leftmost pin on the display, a wire goes from the second leftmost resistor to the second leftmost pin on the display, and so on).
> * Make sure you are placing wires in the same row as the row that has one end of of the resistor in it, and not in the empty rows between resistors.

> #### Success::Check your Circuit
>
> Before continuing, check your circuit to confirm it is wired correctly. Ask a mentor to double check the circuit after you have checked it.
>
> This circuit has a lot of wiring and components that are placed close to each other. Ensure all the connections are correct and that there are no short circuits created by exposed conductors.
>
> Congratulations! You've finished building the display circuit.
