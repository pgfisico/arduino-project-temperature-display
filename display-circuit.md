# Display Circuit

You will now build the display, so that the temperature can be displayed on it rather than the computer. The display will be made up of the following components.

## 7-Segment Display

- Common a/C
- Photo of segment labels, individual LEDs

## Shift Register


- Notch, pin numbering
- Why used
- Internal logic
-- OE???
-- Chaining???


Disconnect the Arduino board from the computer and construct the circuit pictured on this page.
*** ADD-ON

** WARN - breaking pins on ICs

> #### Warning::ESD Sensitive
> The 7-segment displays and shift registers are ESD sensitive

-- NOte that caps are reused here - close to IC



> #### Success::Check your Circuit
> Before continuing, check your circuit to confirm it is wired correctly
