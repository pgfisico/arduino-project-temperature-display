# Display Circuit

You will now build the display, so that the temperature can be displayed on it rather than the computer.

Disconnect the Arduino board from the computer and construct the circuit pictured on this page.

The blue component behind the temperature sensor is a 0.1&micro;F (0.1 microfarad) capacitor. It should be placed as close as possible to the temperature sensor, and is connected across the power and ground pins of the sensor.
