# Temperature Sensor and Display Test

---

#TODO
Scope display FYI
---

Connect the Arduino board to the computer and upload the program.

Watch the display. **Make sure that the temperature it displays is close to room temperature.**

Grab the black plastic portion of the temperature sensor between two fingers (Being careful not to disconnect any wires or short circuit any exposed leads on the sensor or capacitor). **You should see the temperature rise over time.**

Let go of the temperature sensor. **You should see the temperature drop over time.**


> #### Success::The Temperature Display Works!
>
> If the temperature on the display is a reasonable value and changes, the temperature display is working.
>
> If the display doesn't seem right, double check your code. If you can't figure out the problem, ask a mentor for help.
