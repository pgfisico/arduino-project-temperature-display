// Add scope display


Watch the output in the Serial Monitor. **Make sure that the temperature it displays is close to room temperature.**

Grab the black plastic portion of the temperature sensor between two fingers (Being careful not to disconnect any wires or short circuit any exposed leads on the sensor or capacitor). **You should see the temperature rise over time.**

Let go of the temperature sensor. **You should see the temperature drop over time.**

> #### Success::The Temperature Sensor Works!
>
> If you get reasonable temperature values from the above tests, the temperature sensor is working.
>
> If the values you get don't make sense, double check your code and circuit. If you can't figure out the problem, ask a mentor for help.
