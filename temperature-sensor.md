# Temperature Sensor

> #### Warning::ESD Sensitive
>
> The temperature sensor is ESD sensitive

The temperature sensor you will use in this project indicates the measured temperature by changing the voltage on one of its pins. You can measure the voltage on this pin by connecting it to the analog input pins on the Arduino. Using the Arduino's analog to digital converter \(ADC\), you can use the numerical voltage value and information from the sensor manufacturer to calculate the temperature.
